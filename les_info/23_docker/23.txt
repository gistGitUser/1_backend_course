//create new branch for feature
git checkout -b ft/docker

//change some file and after push to new branch ur feature:
git commit -m "add feature in les 23"
//choose new branch for pushing
git push origin ft/docker

//create new image
```
FROM golang:1.20-alpine3.18
# declare current working directiry inside the image
WORKDIR /app
# first point mean that we copy all from current dir
COPY . .

RUN go build -o project/main project/main.go

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["app/project/main"]
```

run command
docker build -t simplebank:latest .

but image size to large ~ 600mb

we can user multi-stage build for reduce image size

modify `Docker` file

```
# BUILD STAGE
# add AS BUILDER for creating build stage
FROM golang:1.20-alpine3.18 AS builder
# declare current working directiry inside the image
WORKDIR /app
# first point mean that we copy all from current dir
COPY . .

RUN go build -o project/main project/main.go


# RUN STAGE
# use alpine linux image
FROM alpine:3.18

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /app/project/main .

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["app/project/main"]
```

//and run command
docker build -t simplebank:latest .

//find our new image
docker images | grep simple
//find old image and remove it
docker images | grep none
docker rmi bb4558baef41
