ACID property (4 properties of db transaction)

Atomicity - either all operation complete succesfully
or the transaction fails and the db is unchanged.

Consistency - the db state must be valid after tge transaction.
All constraint must be satisfied.

Isolation - concurrent transaction must not affect each other.

Durability - data written by a successful transaction must be recorded in
persist storage.


Read phenomena

 * dirty read - a transaction reads data written by other concurrent
   uncommitted transaction
 * non-repeatable read - a transaction reads the same row twice and sees
   different value because it has been modified by other committed transaction

 * phantom read - a transaction re-executes a query to find rows that satisfy
   a condition and sees a different set of rows, due to changes by other commited
   transaction.

 * serialization anomaly - the result of a group of concurrent committed transaction
   is impossible to achieve if we try to run them
   sequentially in any order without overlapping.


4 standards of isolation levels

1) Read uncommitted -> can see data written by uncommitted transaction
allows:

 * phantom read
 * non-repeatable read
 * serialization anomaly

2) Read committed - only see data written by committed transaction
     * phantom read
     * non-repeatable read
     * serialization anomaly

3) Repeatable read - same query read query always return the same result
    * serialization anomaly
4) serializable - can achieve the same result if execute transaction serially
in some order instead of concurrently
    * no one

//postgres show lvl isolation
show transaction_isolation;

/*
in postgres u can set isolation level only for certain transaction
i.e. in mysql u can set transaction for whole session

ERROR:  SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL must be called BEFORE any query
*/

begin;
set transaction isolation level read uncommited;
